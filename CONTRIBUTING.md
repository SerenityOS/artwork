# Contributing Artwork

When contributing artwork, please place each file in the correct folder. The
folders are:

- `images`: Still images or GIF files.
- `videos`: Video files.
- `sounds`: Short jingles and sound effects.
- `music`: Music, tracker files and MIDI files.

Please make sure the artwork is original, or sufficiently transformative if
not.

Please add your name and the file you have added to the AUTHORS.md file, so
that the source can correctly be attributed to you when the artwork is used
elsewhere. Use this format:

``- [`images/some_image.png`](images/some_image.png) - [@your_handle](github,twitter,etc.) - Optional license``

By default, artwork in this repository are licensed under CC-BY 4.0. If you
wish to specify a different license for your artwork, please include the
license as an item at the end.
